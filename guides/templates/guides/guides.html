                Unfortunately CSDT will not work with an iPhone/Android phone. This is because CSNAP, our "blocks" program, is not supported in a phone browser. We are, however, replacing CSNAP with <a href="https://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Scratch_3.0">Scratch 3.0</a>, which will be fully compatible with cell phones and tablets. If you only have a phone but are interested in coding, we recommend the game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/human-resource-machine/id1005098334?mt=8">Human Resource Machine</a>  which teaches assembler.

                <p>We recommend that you get a desktop computer, however, so that you can do CSDT modules and truly begin to learn to code. This can be accomplished by buying a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi 3</a>, which is a cheap ($50) desktop computer specifically designed so kids can learn programming. Have a bake sale or a lemonade stand to raise money for a Raspberry Pi! Then you'll have a dedicated desktop to do CSDTs and then afterwards learn python, java, ruby, javascript, linux, c++, etc. Remember that you can still read all the CSDT pages on a cell phone, but to do the simulations you will have to have a desktop computer. You can go to the public library and use a public computer there if you have a public library card.

                Congratulations! Thank you for using our site! We hope it taught you how integral math is to cultures around the world and how computer science is related to art and design in those cultures! Good news if you're interested in learning more about coding, because computer science is all about <i>computers</i> and <i>the internet</i>, so you can very easily learn computer science <i>for free</i> using online resources that have texts and books about coding, as well as free video tutorials as long as you have an internet connection that is fast enough for videos (which you can always get at the public library). There are plenty of free online resources where you can learn computer science fundamentals <i>for free</i>. There are also plenty of computer science textbooks at the public library too. Don't be intimidated by their huge size! You might think because they are such big books that they are for advanced programmers, but actually those big books are for <i>beginners</i> because all those pages are dedicated to taking you through the stages of learning to code beginning from the very basics. In fact, little/thinner books are usually more advanced! The Dewey Decimal System has the following codes for computer science:<br><br>
                000 Computer science, knowledge & systems<br>
                000 Computer science, information & general works<br>
                001 Knowledge<br>
                002 The book<br>
                003 Systems<br>
                004 Data processing & computer science<br>
                005 Computer programming, programs & data<br>
                006 Special computer methods<br>
                007-009 [Unassigned]<br><br>
                Check out a book on a programming language that interests you (Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, Go, etc.) and work through the tutorials in the book, retyping all the code that is included in the lessons. You'll learn computer science principles along the way and begin your long process of beginning a programmer. Don't stop at learning just one computer programming language, though! Keep learning new ones as soon as you become an expert in one language, that way your resume will show a broad knowledge of programming languages that will help you be qualified for a larger multitude of jobs.
                <p>
                    There are also many resources for learning Computer Science online. In fact, there are dedicated educational companies that produce computer science classes online <i>for free</i> just to share on the internet! You might think, how is this possible? College usually isn't free! But the circumstances are such that most future jobs will require computer science and coding knowledge, so there is plenty of funding for general access online computer science classes because so many people are going to need to become computer scientists to fulfill all the jobs being created in the computer science industry. So because there is high demand for computer scientists, there is plenty of public financial support for free online computer science classes. There is, for example, a <a href="http://www.uopeople.edu">$4000 online computer science bachelors of science degree</a> which gives you an accredited computer science BS via classes that use Open Educational Resource (open source) textbooks that are free to download and read. You don't have to pay for textbooks! That is because the open source movement has effected computer science education to the point that there are free CS textbooks! There is, to say the least, a wealth of computer science educational resources for no cost at all that, with a lot of hard work and dedication, will teach the equivalence of a college degree at no cost! This is a great benefit of becoming a computer scientist, it is one of the rare professions that can be learned at zero to very low cost. This is because there is such a high demand for computer scientists.

            <br>
                    As you can see the situation is more that there are <i>MORE</i> online computer science classes than anyone could possibly learn in a lifetime! You could dedicate every hour of your waking life to learning computer science through the sites above and still only scratch the surface of all the free computer science classes available online. If you took the time to browse through each of the links above (and we hope you do!), a few things should be apparent: 1) You can learn computer science online. It will take motivation and hard-work (and a lot of hours of study!), but everything you could possibly learn about CS is available in an online class. And there will only be more classes posted in the future, too! You can keep a log of the courses you study on an online resume like LinkedIn under "education" (just put coursera/edx/udacity/youtube instead of a school) 2) These courses make a great supplement to college computer science courses. They are sort of like cliffs notes for college CS classes. Whatever isn't covered in your classes usually is brought up in the video tutorials that are on YouTube, giving you a better overview of the topic than just classes alone. 3) Public Libraries offer a goldmine of CS resources. Many libraries have many volumes on web and computer programming books. They also sometimes subscribe to premium coding resources like teamtreehouse.com or lynda.com, which both contain free programming video tutorials. My public library, for example, subscribed to teamtreehouse.com (a $25/month value) and I studied that nonstop for two years, learning enough to land my first programming internship on a web team coding Angular2 apps. Without the public library, I wouldn't have had the web development skills to land my first programming job. Ask your public library if they will subscribe to teamtreehouse.com or lynda.com! They also have public computers where you can program and watch videos through coursera/udacity/itunes u/edx/youtube. There is no better partner in your quest to become a computer scientist than the public library! Use it for all its worth! Also remember about InterLibrary Loans, where you can request a book and it'll be shipped anywhere for you to read at your public library. 4) A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is invaluable in your quest to become a computer scientist. The simple fact is, you are going to have to learn linux if you want to be a developer, and the Raspberry Pi is a cheap beginners resource for learning linux/debian. It's a no-risk computer that you can experiment without risking your parent's personal property, for example. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the command line and linux.
